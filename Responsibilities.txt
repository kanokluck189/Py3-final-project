Core Gameplay
    The game supports many players in a multiplayer session
    Players move around a 2D top-down map
    At the start of each round:

    One player is randomly selected as “It”
    The player who is “It” can tag other players by touching them
    When a player is tagged:
    They become the new “It” freeze for 3 seconds, get smaller and move faster
    A cooldown prevents immediate re-tagging
    The game continues endlessly with players tagging each other
